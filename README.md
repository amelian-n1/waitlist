# Waitlist

Goals

•	My goal is to create an open source tool for online sellers to add a waitlist feature to their website for customers to order from incoming shipments. This will allow customers to secure their order ahead of time and ensure access to high demand items.

•	Additionally, the tool will help sellers manage demand by giving them the option to place limits on how many items a customer can order.

•	The tool should easily integrate into a seller’s current business processes, allowing them to better serve their customers while increasing profits.

Background and Strategic Fit

The current pandemic has greatly altered customers shopping habits both online and in store. The hoarding of essential products like toilet paper, food, medications, and cleaning supplies caused worry and panic amongst shoppers. More customers are choosing to shop online gather than risk contracting COVID-19 by shopping in store.

Most ecommerce websites do not have a waitlist option for customers. A waitlist would allow the customers in dire need of certain products to guarantee they would receive them at some point. It would also save customers time by avoiding having to constantly check back to see if a product is back in stock. Additionally, sellers should be able limit purchase quantities to prevent people from hoarding essential products.
