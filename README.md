# Waitlist

Goals
•	My goal is to create an open source tool that online sellers can use to add a waitlist feature to their website. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, online stores are selling out of essential products more frequently and customers need a way to guarantee they will receive them at some point.
•	The tool should easily integrate into a seller’s current business processes, allowing them to better serve their customers while increasing profits.

Background and Strategic Fit

The current pandemic has greatly altered customers shopping habits both online and in store. The hoarding of essential products like toilet paper, food, medications and cleaning supplies. has become a massive problem. Sellers are frequently selling out of these products and unable to keep up with customer demand. More customers are choosing to shop online gather than risk contracting COVID-19 by shopping in store.

Most ecommerce websites do not have a waitlist option for customers. A waitlist would allow the customers in dire need of certain products to guarantee they would receive them at some point. It would also save them time by not having to check back constantly to see if a product is back in stock. Additionally, sellers can limit purchase quantities to prevent people from hoarding essential products. Sellers can guarantee their customers will purchase from them rather than another store. This tool will be helpful to both sellers and customers, as well as support flattening the curve by decreasing the need to visit stores in person.
